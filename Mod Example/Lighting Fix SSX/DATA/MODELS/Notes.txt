Elysium Alps:

- same for manmade objects, seriously, what is it with this game and its stupid ambient colors?

Mesablanca:

- the rock walls that make up the level have lost some of their color, the rock objects on the ground reveal their original color

Tokyo Megaplex:

- Back Poles

Pipedream:

- the giant room with the PIPEDREAM sign written in rails is actually too bright compared to vanilla, the entire level is supposed to look like they have the lights on very low, unlike Warmup which is supposed to be really bright

Misc:

- Hud Patch
